There are three categories of lifecycle methods: _mounting_, _updating_, and _unmounting_.

## _Mounting_ lifecycle methods
A component `mounts` when it renders for the _first time_. This is when `mounting lifecycle methods` get called. There are three mounting lifecycle methods:
* componentWillMount
* render
* componentDidMount: gets called right after the HTML from render has finished loading. 
    * _componentDidMount_ is a good place to connect a React app to external applications, such as web APIs or JavaScript frameworks.
    * _componentDidMount_ is also the place to set timers using setTimeout or setInterval.

When a component mounts, it automatically calls these three methods, in order.

## _Updating_ Lifecycle Methods
The first time that a component instance renders, it does not update. A component updates every time that it renders, _starting with the second render_.

There are five updating lifecycle methods:

* componentWillReceiveProps: comparing incoming **props** to current **props** or **state**, and deciding what to render based on that comparison.

* shouldComponentUpdate: automatically receives two arguments: `nextProps` and `nextState`. Itâ€™s typical to compare `nextProps` and `nextState` to the current `this.props` and `this.state`, and use the results to decide what to do. Should return either `true` or `false`.
   * If `shouldComponentUpdate` returns `true`, then nothing noticeable happens. 
   * But if `shouldComponentUpdate` returns `false`, then the component will not update! None of the remaining lifecycle methods for that updating period will be called, including `render`.
   * The best way to use `shouldComponentUpdate` is to have it return `false` _only under certain conditions_. If those conditions are met, then your component will not update.
   
* componentWillUpdate: receives two arguments: `nextProps` and `nextState`. You cannot call `this.setState` from the body of `componentWillUpdate`!

* render: belongs to two categories: _mounting lifecycle methods_, and _updating lifecycle methods_.

* componentDidUpdate

Whenever a component instance updates, it automatically calls all five of these methods, in order.
