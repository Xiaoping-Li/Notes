There are three categories of lifecycle methods: _mounting_, _updating_, and _unmounting_.

## _Mounting_ lifecycle methods
A component `mounts` when it renders for the _first time_. This is when `mounting lifecycle methods` get called. There are three mounting lifecycle methods:
```
componentWillMount
render
componentDidMount
```
When a component mounts, it automatically calls these three methods, in order.
