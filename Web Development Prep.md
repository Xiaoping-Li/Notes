## Javascript Promises
One of the most commonly asked questions around Javascript is about Promises. Be prepared to write some code around promises in an interview. It’s also a good skill to have! You probably
want to review the following subjects:

### What is a promise?
A promise is an object which can be returned synchronously from an asynchronous function. It will be in one of 3 possible states:
* **Fulfilled**: onFulfilled() will be called (e.g., resolve() was called)
* **Rejected**: onRejected() will be called (e.g., reject() was called)
* **Pending**: not yet fulfilled or rejected



### How do you write your own promise?
### How do you get the result of a promise (ex. from an API call)?
### How do you get the result from multiple promises in order (using Promise.all, etc.)?
