# Arithmetic Operators
## Operator Types
* **Unary**: A _unary_ operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator, following this format:
```
operand operator
operator operand
```
For example, in the expression `a++`, `++` is a unary operator.
* **Binary**: A _binary_ operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator, following this format:
```
operand1 operator operand2
```
For example, in the expression `a + b = c`, `+` is a binary operator.
