In short, variables _label_ and _store_ data in memory. There are only a few things you can do with variables:
* Create a variable with a descriptive name.
* Store or update information stored in a variable.
* Reference or “get” information stored in a variable.

It is important to distinguish that _variables_ are not _values_; they contain values and represent them with a name.
