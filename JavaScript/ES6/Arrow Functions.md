ES6 provides us with the syntactic sugar of anonymous functions: **arrow function syntax**
```
const myFunc = () => {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}
```
When there is no function body, and only a return value, arrow function syntax allows you to omit the keyword return as well as the brackets surrounding the code. This helps simplify smaller functions into one-line statements:
```
const myFunc = () => "value"
```
