ES6 provides us with the syntactic sugar of anonymous functions: **arrow function syntax**
```
const myFunc = () => {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}
```
When there is no function body, and only a return value, arrow function syntax allows you to omit the keyword return as well as the brackets surrounding the code. This helps simplify smaller functions into one-line statements:
```
const myFunc = () => "value"
```
1. Arrow functions work really well with higher order functions, such as map(), filter(), and reduce(), that take other functions as arguments for processing collections of data.

Read the following code:
```
FBPosts.filter(function(post) {
  return post.thumbnail !== null && post.shares > 100 && post.likes > 500;
})
```
We have written this with filter() to at least make it somewhat readable. Now compare it to the following code which uses arrow function syntax instead:
```
FBPosts.filter((post) => post.thumbnail !== null && post.shares > 100 && post.likes > 500)
```
This code is more succinct and accomplishes the same task with fewer lines of code.
