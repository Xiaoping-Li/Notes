# JavaScript's Data Types
The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:

* A primitive value or data type is data that is not an object and has no methods. All primitives are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed. There are six primitive types:
        * Number
        * String
        * Boolean
        * Symbol
        * Null
        * Undefined
* The seventh data type is Object
