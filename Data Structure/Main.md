# Data Structure
## What is a Data Structure?
A `data structure` (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

## Complexity Analysis
As programmers, we often find ourselves asking the sam two questions over and over again:
* How much **time** does this algorithm need to finish?
* How much **space** does this algorithm need for its computation?

### Big-O Notation
`Big-O Notation` gives an _upper bound_ of the complexity in the **worst** case, helping to quantify performance as the input size becomes **arbitrarily large**.

**Big-O Notation**  
(n -The size of the input)   
(Complexities ordered from smallest to largest)
