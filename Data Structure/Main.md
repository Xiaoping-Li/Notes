# Data Structure
## What is a Data Structure?
A `data structure` (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

## Complexity Analysis
As programmers, we often find ourselves asking the sam two questions over and over again:
* How much **time** does this algorithm need to finish?
* How much **space** does this algorithm need for its computation?

### Big-O Notation
`Big-O Notation` gives an _upper bound_ of the complexity in the **worst** case, helping to quantify performance as the input size becomes **arbitrarily large**.

**Big-O Notation**  
(n -The size of the input)   
(Complexities ordered from smallest to largest)  

|Type  |         | Example |  
|------:|:-------:|:-----:|
| Constant Time: |  O(1) |  |
| Logarithmic Time: |  O(log(n)) |  |
| Linear Time: |  O(n) |  |
| Linearithmic Time: |  O(nlog(n)) | merge sort  |
| Quadric Time: |  O(n^2) |   |
| Cubic Time: |  O(n^3) |   |
| Exponential Time: |  O(b^n), b > 1 | Finding all subsets of a set - O(2^n)|
| Factorial Time: |  O(n!) | Finding all permutations of a string|
