## JavaScript Hoisting






## ES6
Some companies want to test your knowledge specifically about modern Javascript. Some example questions are:
### What is your favourite feature of ES6?
#### `let` and `const`

* `var` keyword defines a _function-scoped_ variable. Variables declared using `var` are also hoisted.
* The `let` keyword defines a _block-scoped_ variable. Block-scoped means the declaration is only available within a so-called “block”.
* `const` declares a _block-scoped_ constant. A constant is like a variable, except you can’t change its value.
* Variables and constants declared with `let` or `const` are not hoisted!
