# max-width
The `max-width` property is used to set the _maximum width_ of an element.

The `max-width` can be specified in length values, like px, cm, etc., or in percent (%) of the containing block, or set to none (this is default. Means that there is no maximum width).

The problem with the `width` occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width value of the element (like 500px). The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.

Using `max-width` instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows.
