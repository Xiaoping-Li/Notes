# Mongoose
## Defining your schema
Everything in Mongoose starts with a Schema. Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection and defines the shape of the documents within that collection.
```
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

// Create User Schema
const UserSchema = new Schema({

});
```
Schemas not only define the structure of your document and casting of properties, they also `define document instance methods`, `static Model methods`, `compound indexes`, and `document lifecycle hooks` called _middleware_.

## Creating a model
To use our schema definition, we need to convert our `UserSchema` into a **Model** we can work with. To do so, we pass it into `mongoose.model(modelName, schema)`:
```
// Create User Model
const UserModel = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);

module.exports = UserModel;
```
**Models** are fancy `constructors` compiled from `Schema` definitions. An instance of a model is called a `document`. Models are responsible for `creating and reading documents from the underlying MongoDB database`.

### Compiling your first model
When you call `mongoose.model()` on a schema, Mongoose _compiles_ a model for you.
```
var schema = new mongoose.Schema({ name: 'string', size: 'string' });
var Tank = mongoose.model('Tank', schema);
```
The _first argument_ is the **_singular_** name of the collection your model is for. Mongoose automatically looks for the **plural, lowercased version of your model name**. Thus, for the example above, the model `Tank` is for the **tanks** collection in the database.

**Note**: The `.model()` function makes a copy of schema. Make sure that you've added everything you want to schema, including hooks, before calling `.model()`!
