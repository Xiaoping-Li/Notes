# Mongoose
## Defining your schema
Everything in Mongoose starts with a Schema. Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection and defines the shape of the documents within that collection.
```
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

// Create User Schema
const UserSchema = new Schema({

});
```
Schemas not only define the structure of your document and casting of properties, they also `define document instance methods`, `static Model methods`, `compound indexes`, and `document lifecycle hooks` called _middleware_.

## Creating a model
To use our schema definition, we need to convert our `UserSchema` into a **Model** we can work with. To do so, we pass it into `mongoose.model(modelName, schema)`:
```
// Create User Model
const UserModel = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);

module.exports = UserModel;
```
